# Docker
## Docker Image
- It is like a set up for docker container or we could say it's a initialize env after build by docker
- Able to store it in ***Registry***, for others to reused it as well.

## Dockerfile

The commands to set up a docker image.

- The root path of the source file will be the same where the Dockerfile exists.
